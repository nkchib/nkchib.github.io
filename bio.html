  <p><tr><th><text=white>Hi, my name is Nicholas Chib, and I am a student in the tenth grade at Ruben S. Ayala High School. 
  
  One important thing about me is that I love music, especially Jazz. 
  I have been playing the trombone since the fifth grade, as well as the euphonium since the sixth grade. 
  I am currently a member of the Ayala Band and Colorguard, and Ayala's Jazz and Wind Ensembles.
  Along with my passion for music, I also am very interested in Engineering and Computer Science. 
  From a young age, I have always wanted to know how and why things work. 
  This inspired me to join Ayala's Engineering Acedemy.
  I am currently in my second year in the Engineering Academy, 
  and I have already learned a lot about the engineering feild so far.
  As I continue to be a part of this unique program, 
  my interest for the engineering feild grows, 
  and I look forward to all of the things I have yet to learn.  </p>
